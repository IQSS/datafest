## Next steps and Resources

GitKraken offers an easy way of getting started with GitHub and version control. Depending on your use case it may be sufficient for your needs. If you are already familiar with using the Command Line then using Git on the Command Line is recommended. 

This lesson introduced you to the most rudimentary (yet very useful) concepts and terminology associated with using Version control (Git). The resources below will allow you get started with getting a deeper/better understanding of version control.

* The [GitKraken guide](https://support.gitkraken.com/getting-started/guide) is a great way to start exploring it's functionality, and learning more about what Git can do.
* GitHub also provides extensive support in the form of [guides](https://guides.github.com/) and [help](https://help.github.com/).
* GitHub [Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) outlines the most commonly used GitHub/Git terminology.

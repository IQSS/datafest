# Versioning your Data and Scripts
Tuesday January 17, 2017<br>
2:15pm - 3:45pm <br>

## Overview:
Tired of wading through files/folders titled 'paper_v1', 'paper_v2', 'paper_v3_beforeAdvisor'... ? This hands-on workshop will introduce the concepts of using a *version control system* to manage changes and the history of your data files (text, web, scripts, etc.). Attendees will participate in multiple exercises in setting up repositories, where the changes and history are stored, working through the iterative process of altering files & recording changes, and rewinding the clock to retrieve a file at any point in the creative process.

## Pre-lesson Preparation:
Please install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com/.

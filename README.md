## Overview:
Tired of wading through files/folders titled 'paper_v1', 'paper_v2', 'paper_v3_beforeAdvisor'... ? This hands-on workshop will introduce the concepts of using a version control system to manage changes and the history of your data files (text, data, scripts, etc.) with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) using the [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) interface, as well as on [GitHub](http://github.com). 

Attendees will participate in multiple exercises to learn how version control works, including: 
* setting up Git repositories
* recording changes
* working both locally and remotely on GitHub
* managing conflicts
* best practices for working with version control

## Pre-lesson Preparation:

1. Please [Download and install GitKraken](https://gitkraken.com/download). 
2. Create an account for yourself on [GitHub](http://github.com). Please be sure to select the free/academic account, as this option has more long-term flexibility.
3. Download the [workshop sample files zipped folder](../../raw/master/data/example_files.zip) and unzip it.

Web Scraping and Web APIs
---------------------------------------------------------

Researchers often need to 
retrieve data from a web service and assemble it into a usable
data set. This workshop will show you how to do that, using the httr
and rvest packages in R.

Prerequisites and Preparation
-----------------------------

If you wish to follow along and try things yourself follow these steps:

- install R from <https://cran.r-project.org/>
- install RStudio from <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>
- install required packages in R with `install.packages(c("httr", "rvest", "jsonlite"))`

A github repository containing the workshop materials is
available <https://github.com/izahn/R_retrieving_data>. You can view lesson notes at 
<https://rawgit.com/izahn/R_retrieving_data/master/retrievingOnlineData.html>

# Interactive Data Visualization with D3

*Also at https://github.com/IQSS/datafest/tree/master/DataFest-2019/data-vis-d3*

<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

In this workshop, we're going present several exercises and go through some core D3 functionality in a whirlwind crash course to this popular library.

## Preparation

+ Clone the repo
+ Get a text editor for writing code
+ Have a local webserver for serving code (Python, ideally)

To prepare for this workshop, please clone this repository with the example exercises and materials.

You'll also need a text editor which ideally includes code formatting and highlighting. I recommend <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> or Sublime, though many others are excellent as well.

You will also need a local webserver. The easiest way to set this up is with <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>. Macs typically have Python installed already; you'll probably need to download and install it on a Windows machine. Check if it's installed on your terminal / command prompt with

`python -V`

Then:

  ```
  # If Python version returned above is 3.X
  python3 -m http.server 2222
  # If Python version returned above is 2.X
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 2222
  ```

This will run it on port 2222; you can use a different port if desired. Run this out of /data-vis-d3/exercises, and you'll be able to easily switch between the exercise materials without closing and restarting the server.

If you can't run a local webserver, you can sign up for a CodePen account and copy the code to a CodePen project instead.

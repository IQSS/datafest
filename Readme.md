of the workshop is for participants to develop skills in working with
data. It is structured around the data lifecycle, includes lectures
and hands-on sessions focused on data concepts, project planning and
data science workflows, processing and analysis, and finally data
dissemination. It is offered to faculty, post-doctorates, graduate and
undergraduate students, and staff at Harvard University.
